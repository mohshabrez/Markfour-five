        <p class="para">Learn things through life

        <h2>IS IIT GOOD!???</h2>
        <p class="para"><h2>
           I hope this was known before.</h2>
           <p class="para"> Studying In IIT makes our life good. This was told by my dad's friend and made me join in IIT institution.
           Then it started. Just we were locked in a seperated sections of room locked and started making bihat the syllabus.
           I got frustared of studies. What am I understand just doing blah blah!!! and vomiting on paper and getting ranks and I am ranker.
           Here I left studying just going sleeping in class and made my 1 year waste.
           Then we had a workshop conducted about IIT and their we met IIT'ians they shared tehre life stories. I dont believe those were real after being an Engineer.
           Full Josh!! The pattren they explained and cracked NIT and went to check the college. But seeing college same mugging. END OF IIT....!!! (REGRET 1)</p>
        </p>
        <h2>Getting seats in Banglore</h2>
        <p class="para">Every day dreamer, It's a dream to do engineering in Banglore.
           <br> Here I decided not to go any IIT or NIT. Lets join in banglore and have enjoyable life. Taking Mechanics as stream</p>
        <p class="para">But getting in college got to know that That was not with NIT and IIT's it was with Indian Education system.(Regret 2 )
            <br>
            Understood at 1st year that Mechanics have no future in India and should shift to <strong>CS</strong>
            <br>I tried all ways to shift but bad luck.
            <br><strong> there is alot from here!!!!!! </strong>
